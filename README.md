# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The purpose of the website is was to learn basic HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript code.
The reason for building this site was also to be used as a continuous study guide on all 4 of these subjects as well. Some of the problems solved were a few troubleshooting and debugging tips and tricks with issues that we shown during the process of making this web page. What I learned from this project was the basic
functionality of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript as well as how to push and pull assignments through Git and Github.
