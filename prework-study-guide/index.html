        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Element is a type of content on a webpage. Text, Image, Header, and List are all commonlly used
              to add contnent to pages.</li>

          <li>Some common elements used to divide and describe a page are, Meta-related, Content division, and Sematic elements</li>

          <li>Building a website is done in steps, just like a house HTML would be considered the frame or blueprint of a webpage.</li>

          <li>Each HTML element has unique rolls.</li>

          <li>"head" element containts informtation, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements included
              within the "head" are not visible to the user viewing the webpage.</li>
            
          <li>"body" elements contain the content that is shown to the user. All elements that the user interacts with are place with the "body"</li>

          <li>"!DOCTYPE" is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>

          <li>"!DOCTYPE" is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case sensitive; however HTML elements are.</li>

          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the begining element, never the closing element.</li>

          <li>Inside the "head" element we can use the following tags:
              <li>"style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a webpage.</li>
              <li>"base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>"link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>"meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>"script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children in this case,
              the "body" element is known as the parent element.</li>
          
          <li>"body" is an example of semantic HTML element. The name of the element in semantic HTML elements, descripes its content and role
              it plays on the webpage.</li>

          <li>It is common to see non-semantic elements such as "div" to create divisions on the page or "span" to create an in line divisin.</li>

          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between and opening tag and a closing tag. Mostly represented by
              angled brackets with associated tag names containted inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash inside the angled brackets.
              we insert the content between opening and closing tags so the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>

          <li>The words "element and "tag" are commonly used in the web development world, bit it is important to know the difference. An element
            refers to the entire element from opening to closing tag, where as tag refers to only what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>"h1", "h2", "h3", "h4, "h5", "h6" elements represent the level of heading a given block of text represents. Headings are larger more
              prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. The "h1" element is always the larges heading on the page.</li>

          <li>"p" element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensivly to wrap most of the text on webpages.</li>

          <li>"ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. These HTML elments represent bulleted or
            numbered lists.</li>

          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. This contains various attributes.</li>
          
          <li>'src' attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>

          <li>'alt' attribute contains a text string that describes the apperance and functionality of the image. This can imprave search engine
              rankings for websites.</li>
          
          <li>"br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of conent.</li>

          <li>"a" element which stands for anchor creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. the 'href' attribuite points to the URL link.</li>

          <li>"section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

          <li>Order matters when using headings, we should use heading tags in order from "h1" to "h6" to make the page accessable to users who access the
              page using screen readers or other devices. The biggest heading "h1" should ONLY appear ONCE on each page.</li>

          <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for chages in the browser, to see if
            the webpage is rendering correctly.</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheet is a programing language used by devs to define how web page content is presented to users. CSS defines, colors,
              aesthetics, visual layout, and orginization.</li>

          <li>There are three wats to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS style sheet.</li>

          <li>An example of Inline CSS is using a style attribute to change the color of a single "h1" heading</li>

          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element. This internal style sheet
              contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs,
              which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page
              elements.</li>

          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certaint condistions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by
              using an external CSS style sheet. This is prefered in most cases because it allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which
              makes design changes easier.</li>

          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's "head".</li>

          <li>Selector: Defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declorations, will apply</li>

          <li>Declorations containt two importaint components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the decloration color:
              blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for the property, blue.</li>

          <li>The Margin Property: acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much spacewe want around the outside of an
              element. The margin is not visible on the page; it adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indication that we want NO extra space
              around the element.</li>

          <li>The Padding Property: is often confused with margin, but is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.
              When you increase padding, youare actually making the entire element bigger! Thats is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the 
              element, wheras the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>

          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and
              the element's boarders, padding, and content. This is sometimes refered to as the CSS Box Model.</li>

          <li>"*" acts a wild card symbol to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page.</li>

          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule by using a "," allowing the declorations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule
              which would add more lines of code and repition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write
              Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>

          <li>DRY is a coding principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of that need to be written or
              maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>

          <li>"text-align: center;" is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>

          <li>The "img" selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assignes
              each image to start on a new line.</li>

          <li>You can alsoe use rules to format any lists or text on your page as well with padding, and "font-size" as well as "p" text.</li>

          <li>To add your CSS code to your HTML code, open your .html file through the proper directory in the command line. Then where the "head" section is, which
              is where we store our metadata. which contains information about the webpage. This is where we'll add a link to our style sheet.</li>

          <li>You would add code such as "link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" a "link" element creates a connection to the external CSS file.</li>

          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>

          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. the href attribute is using a reletive path. This means the location is derived
              from the current location.</li>

          <li>A "." period after a class is called a "class selector" and HTML element assigned to the class, will gain the property assignments from the CSS.</li>

          <li>A border property assigns a border with a width and color</li>

          <li>Width sets the width of an element.</li>

          <li>A margin property assigns a margin to the top, bottom, left and right.</li>

          <li>A box-shadow property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects seperated by commas. A box shadow is described by
              x and y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>

          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can br done in many ways, incluiding by semantic references uch as gray or blue. WE can also refer to a color by its
              hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

          <h2>Javascript</h2>

          <li>Javacript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior or responses when
              buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.</li>

          <li>Javascript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D Graphics,
            Comprihensive database-driven apps, and much more!</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in script.</li>

          <li>"script src=scripts/" is the same as the "link element for CSS, it applies the Javascript to the page, so it can have an effect on the
              HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>

          <li>Javascript is case-sensitive!</li>

          <li>String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks. let myVariable = 'Bob';</li>

          <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.  let myVariable = 10;</li>

          <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.  let myVariable = true;</li>

          <li>Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.  let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
            Refer to each member of the array like this:
            myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.</li>

          <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.  let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
            All of the above examples too.</li>

          <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change 
              an image displayed in an image gallery.</li>

          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:
            /*
            Everything in between is a comment.
            */
            If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:
            // This is a comment
            In coding parlance, a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, use the var keyword. After the var keyword, give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how you will reference 
              the information stored in the variable in the code.</li>

          <li>Use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that you want stored in the variable. In the example involving a container named "shape" that stores a circle, 
            you can express that in JavaScript as follows:
            var shape = "circle";
            All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>

          <li>Use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. An argument is what goes inside the parentheses.</li>

          <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions 
            that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>

          <li>Chrome DevTools, which is an indispensable developers tool that you will use throughout your professional life.</li>

          <li>To open the Chrome DevTools web console, While looking at your index.html file in the browser, right-click anywhere in the browser window and select "Inspect" from the menu.</li>

          <li>You can also open Chrome DevTools using keyboard commands. If youre using macOS, you can press Command+Option+I, and if youre using windows, you can press Control+Shift+I. 
              A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. Click the console tab and you'll see a web console!</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at 
              the bottom of the page.</li>

          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file; we cant just throw it all in there any 
              which way!</li>

          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>

          <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets 
              a condition, or is true.</li>

          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action 
              we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isnt true or has a value that isnt truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets 
              and move on.</li>

          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: "0", "-0", "On", "", "null", "undefined", "NaN", or a "Boolean" data type with the value of false. All other values, 
              including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy</li>

          <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just "if". In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using, "else if".</li>

          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>

          <li>Typically, JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>

          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide 
              between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow. Interrupting the control flow in this way allows us to 
              build apps that respond to a user's actions.</li>

          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>

          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>

          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, you need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. 
              Using each piece of data's index, or location number, you can access individual data inside the array.</li>

          <li>JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>

          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>

          <li>Using a "for" loop, you can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left. In order to use the for loop, you need the shape's index and the 
              array's length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. You can find the length of an array by using a built-in 
              property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>

          <li>A "for" loop contains the following three important statements:

            The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0)
            The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. 
            We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition
            The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. 
            Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>

          <li>A for loop starts with "for"</li>

          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. 
              While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, because you can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it
              also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>

          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>

          <li>To declare a function, you use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then you add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task you want to perform</li>

          <li>To call a function, you use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where wyou want the code to execute.</li>

          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
