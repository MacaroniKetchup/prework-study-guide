        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Element is a type of content on a webpage. Text, Image, Header, and List are all commonlly used
              to add contnent to pages.</li>

          <li>Some common elements used to divide and describe a page are, Meta-related, Content division, and Sematic elements</li>

          <li>Building a website is done in steps, just like a house HTML would be considered the frame or blueprint of a webpage.</li>

          <li>Each HTML element has unique rolls.</li>

          <li>"head" element containts informtation, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements included
              within the "head" are not visible to the user viewing the webpage.</li>
            
          <li>"body" elements contain the content that is shown to the user. All elements that the user interacts with are place with the "body"</li>

          <li>"!DOCTYPE" is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>

          <li>"!DOCTYPE" is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case sensitive; however HTML elements are.</li>

          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the begining element, never the closing element.</li>

          <li>Inside the "head" element we can use the following tags:
              <li>"style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a webpage.</li>
              <li>"base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>"link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>"meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>"script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children in this case,
              the "body" element is known as the parent element.</li>
          
          <li>"body" is an example of semantic HTML element. The name of the element in semantic HTML elements, descripes its content and role
              it plays on the webpage.</li>

          <li>It is common to see non-semantic elements such as "div" to create divisions on the page or "span" to create an in line divisin.</li>

          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between and opening tag and a closing tag. Mostly represented by
              angled brackets with associated tag names containted inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash inside the angled brackets.
              we insert the content between opening and closing tags so the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>

          <li>The words "element and "tag" are commonly used in the web development world, bit it is important to know the difference. An element
            refers to the entire element from opening to closing tag, where as tag refers to only what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>"h1", "h2", "h3", "h4, "h5", "h6" elements represent the level of heading a given block of text represents. Headings are larger more
              prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. The "h1" element is always the larges heading on the page.</li>

          <li>"p" element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensivly to wrap most of the text on webpages.</li>

          <li>"ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. These HTML elments represent bulleted or
            numbered lists.</li>

          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. This contains various attributes.</li>
          
          <li>'src' attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>

          <li>'alt' attribute contains a text string that describes the apperance and functionality of the image. This can imprave search engine
              rankings for websites.</li>
          
          <li>"br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of conent.</li>

          <li>"a" element which stands for anchor creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. the 'href' attribuite points to the URL link.</li>

          <li>"section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

          <li>Order matters when using headings, we should use heading tags in order from "h1" to "h6" to make the page accessable to users who access the
              page using screen readers or other devices. The biggest heading "h1" should ONLY appear ONCE on each page.</li>

          <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for chages in the browser, to see if
            the webpage is rendering correctly.</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheet is a programing language used by devs to define how web page content is presented to users. CSS defines, colors,
              aesthetics, visual layout, and orginization.</li>

          <li>There are three wats to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS style sheet.</li>

          <li>An example of Inline CSS is using a style attribute to change the color of a single "h1" heading</li>

          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element. This internal style sheet
              contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs,
              which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page
              elements.</li>

          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certaint condistions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by
              using an external CSS style sheet. This is prefered in most cases because it allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which
              makes design changes easier.</li>

          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's "head".</li>

          <li>Selector: Defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declorations, will apply</li>

          <li>Declorations containt two importaint components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the decloration color:
              blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for the property, blue.</li>

          <li>The Margin Property: acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much spacewe want around the outside of an
              element. The margin is not visible on the page; it adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indication that we want NO extra space
              around the element.</li>

          <li>The Padding Property: is often confused with margin, but is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.
              When you increase padding, youare actually making the entire element bigger! Thats is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the 
              element, wheras the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>

          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and
              the element's boarders, padding, and content. This is sometimes refered to as the CSS Box Model.</li>

          <li>"*" acts a wild card symbol to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page.</li>

          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule by using a "," allowing the declorations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule
              which would add more lines of code and repition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write
              Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>

          <li>DRY is a coding principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of that need to be written or
              maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>

          <li>"text-align: center;" is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>

          <li>The "img" selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assignes
              each image to start on a new line.</li>

          <li>You can alsoe use rules to format any lists or text on your page as well with padding, and "font-size" as well as "p" text.</li>

          <li>To add your CSS code to your HTML code, open your .html file through the proper directory in the command line. Then where the "head" section is, which
              is where we store our metadata. which contains information about the webpage. This is where we'll add a link to our style sheet.</li>

          <li>You would add code such as "link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" a "link" element creates a connection to the external CSS file.</li>

          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>

          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. the href attribute is using a reletive path. This means the location is derived
              from the current location.</li>

          <li>A "." period after a class is called a "class selector" and HTML element assigned to the class, will gain the property assignments from the CSS.</li>

          <li>A border property assigns a border with a width and color</li>

          <li>Width sets the width of an element.</li>

          <li>A margin property assigns a margin to the top, bottom, left and right.</li>

          <li>A box-shadow property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects seperated by commas. A box shadow is described by
              x and y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>

          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can br done in many ways, incluiding by semantic references uch as gray or blue. WE can also refer to a color by its
              hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
