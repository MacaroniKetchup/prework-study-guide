        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Element is a type of content on a webpage. Text, Image, Header, and List are all commonlly used
              to add contnent to pages.</li>

          <li>Some common elements used to divide and describe a page are, Meta-related, Content division, and Sematic elements</li>

          <li>Building a website is done in steps, just like a house HTML would be considered the frame or blueprint of a webpage.</li>

          <li>Each HTML element has unique rolls.</li>

          <li>"head" element containts informtation, or metadata, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements included
              within the "head" are not visible to the user viewing the webpage.</li>
            
          <li>"body" elements contain the content that is shown to the user. All elements that the user interacts with are place with the "body"</li>

          <li>"!DOCTYPE" is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>

          <li>"!DOCTYPE" is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case sensitive; however HTML elements are.</li>

          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the begining element, never the closing element.</li>

          <li>Inside the "head" element we can use the following tags:
              <li>"style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a webpage.</li>
              <li>"base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>"link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>"meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>"script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds all the children in this case,
              the "body" element is known as the parent element.</li>
          
          <li>"body" is an example of semantic HTML element. The name of the element in semantic HTML elements, descripes its content and role
              it plays on the webpage.</li>

          <li>It is common to see non-semantic elements such as "div" to create divisions on the page or "span" to create an in line divisin.</li>

          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between and opening tag and a closing tag. Mostly represented by
              angled brackets with associated tag names containted inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash inside the angled brackets.
              we insert the content between opening and closing tags so the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>

          <li>The words "element and "tag" are commonly used in the web development world, bit it is important to know the difference. An element
            refers to the entire element from opening to closing tag, where as tag refers to only what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>"h1", "h2", "h3", "h4, "h5", "h6" elements represent the level of heading a given block of text represents. Headings are larger more
              prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. The "h1" element is always the larges heading on the page.</li>

          <li>"p" element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensivly to wrap most of the text on webpages.</li>

          <li>"ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. These HTML elments represent bulleted or
            numbered lists.</li>

          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. This contains various attributes.</li>
          
          <li>'src' attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>

          <li>'alt' attribute contains a text string that describes the apperance and functionality of the image. This can imprave search engine
              rankings for websites.</li>
          
          <li>"br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of conent.</li>

          <li>"a" element which stands for anchor creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. the 'href' attribuite points to the URL link.</li>

          <li>"section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

          <li>Order matters when using headings, we should use heading tags in order from "h1" to "h6" to make the page accessable to users who access the
              page using screen readers or other devices. The biggest heading "h1" should ONLY appear ONCE on each page.</li>

          <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for chages in the browser, to see if
            the webpage is rendering correctly.</li>
